## What does this framework offer?
- grid
- buttons
- typography (paragraph, link and headings)

## Why did @hjemmesidekongen create this framework?
Basically almost all frameworks are bloated. 

In the last 10 projects i've only used 20% of the entire CSS framework. But was forced to load the entire 100% of the framework. This lead to a +150kb. not-needed code-load on each pageload - that is silly.
